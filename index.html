	<h3>the workplace</h3>
	<div class="paragraph">
	<p>when we got there we got on the elevator and went up to what i assume is the 6th floor. when we got to the archo malmo office the first thiing i noticed was the ping pong table in the middle of the room. it had aalot of places to sit. It seemes like a very chill and realxed work space.there was aslo a place to hang bikes for the peopple who bike to work. The workers there are aloud to take thier dogs to work. everyone there dresses very casual so no need for any fancy suits. they have "unlimited" days off from work, but of course if they are behind on a project there is no time for days off.The guy sat us down and started talking to us about what archer malmo was all about and also what he does. </p>

	<h3> what i learned</h3>

	<div class="paragraph">
	<p> what i learned about what they do was that they make websites for all types of businesses. they makes sketches and present them to the customer for approval. if the customer does like it they would have to make a whole new sketches. they have more then one person work on the websites. over 5 people work on the same website. that helps get work done faster. they each have thier own take for the website and then they just combine everthing to complete it.   </p>

	<p> After the presentaion the guy took us to the other floors of archor malmo. On one of the floor they had a xmas tree but it wasnt a normal tree though it was a ladder with christmas decorations. they had a huge clear box full of random tropheies. then he took us to another floor where they have there photo shoot area.right by the door they had a awsome painting that i really liked. it was 2 robots and a computer in a cafe like area. they can paint the room to what ever color they need. they also shoot videos and so they make the photo booth a stage.  he told us that they are working on a vr project. after visiting the photo booth it was time for us to go and we made our way back to the bus.</p>
